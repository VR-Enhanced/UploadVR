        "This year at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) marked the arrival of consumer virtual reality headsets as various types of VR technologies flooded the scene. Yet at the same time, augmented reality and computer vision techniques burst into the conference showing clues that the future of optical computing might eventually produce a fashionable set of powerful glasses; which will hit the mainstream like nothing ever seen before.",
        "Hints of this idea sprouted up here and there during CES. One of the biggest indications of the possible effects of integrating VR and AR was noticed through the impact that the American superconductor company known as Qualcomm had at the show.",
        "Looking closer into the subject revealed that strands of emerging technologies at CES 2015 attracted a lot of attention separately but were held together by research done by Qualcomm.",
        "Qualcomm's influence was uncovered in the most unlikely of areas during the conference. For instance, the company introduced a multi-mode autonomous drone that can ‘see' items in 3D called the Snapdragon Cargo. The integrated code helps robots perceive their environment allowing for complex image processing and maneuverability",
        "Extensions of this type of computer vision technology can be used in virtual reality applications as well as augmented reality, and Qualcomm is showing hints of that.",
        "Another good example of their research teams' work was their wearable device called the ODG R-7 Glasses which are labeled as “augmented reality (AR) head-worn computing technology”. As their product press release states, the ODG Glasses currently run off of a “Snapdragon™ 805 processor, with an integrated Adreno™ 420 GPU for stunning graphics and a power optimized DSP for advanced camera processing.” Their proprietary electro-optic, computing, sensor and power systems provide for the ability for developers to create truly immersive 3D stereoscopic experiences.",
        "Their glasses are for the most part wireless, opening up the door for peer-to-peer data streaming. Embedded in the frame itself is a built in camera recording capture moments in time; all of which can be backed up to a server on or transmitted to someone nearby.",
        "Even more exciting is the augmented reality and computer image processing capabilities. These glasses have a see-through “heads up” display with a resolution of 720p. It runs at 100 frames per second, and is based on ReticleOS, a version of Android 4.4.3 (KitKat) optimized for head-worn computing",
        "The technology that the research team came up with is being used in the Infinity AR system. Essentially, the Infinity glasses and the ODG versions are the same package wrapped up in a different name.",
        "Applications for these glasses have already been tested out. At the main Qualcomm booth during CES, they showcased features that could be integrated into planes. Using headsets like the ODG or Infinity AR, pilots can detect changes in the dashboard cycles and make decisions based on that data.",
        "Another fun component is the option to play AR-related games based on tracking cues from real life environments. People can possibly draw patterns on portable surfaces which then are recognized by the glasses causing the software to initiate a game like chess or checkers. Both individuals wearing the headsets could potentially see what they other person saw, allowing for in-depth multi-player interactions.",
        "On a more practically level, glasses similar to Infinity AR can depict weather patterns on any wall, provide additional popup-content depending on what is being read, allow for people to choose what types of clothes they want to buy, take phone calls, give directions, and much much more.",
        "The challenge though for companies developing AR+VR headsets is that they have to bring down the price towards something that the masses can buy all at once. Thousands upon thousands of dollars is just too costly for large scale adoption. It would need to dip around the low hundreds in order to proliferate wildly into the market.",
        "However, once virtual reality and augmented realty worlds collide, feelings of presence will reach exponential levels. It won't matter what someone sees or what they touch, whether virtual or augmented, the objects will simply seem all real.",
        "Eventually, the world can be drastically changed with a flip of a switch; altering whatever the wearer of the VR+AR headset will see. It strikes a similar path into what the Japanese science fiction anime Dennō Coil depicts about an immersive augmented reality technology that is beginning to hit the mainstream.",
        "Honestly, I don't think the technology is that far off from the projected high-tech world of Dennō Coil is described as. Just look towards the Infinity AR glasses as a proof of concept that the medium is already emerging. Surely it will take time to get the tracking cues just right, and of course there still has to be tons of programming hours in order to link all the headsets together seamlessly, but the groundwork has already been laid.",
        "Now, it is up to the developers around the globe to take this type of system to a whole new dimension. Luckily, Qualcomm has a computer vision SDK known as Vuforia for those interested in building on their platform. Their global ecosystem at the time of writing this post consists of 125,000+ registered developers and powers 10,000+ apps with more than 150 million app installs worldwide. That is pretty damn impressive for a platform that is just starting to see the light of day.",
        "For more information about what Qualcomm is working on, be sure to visit their main research website. In addition, if you haven't seen Dennō Coil yet, check it out! It has some great insight into what the computer generated world of AR+VR might look like. Read the Wikipedia article about this series to learn more."

        "Here at the Upload Journal, we talk a lot about Virtual Reality’s uses beyond gaming. The potentials for this platform are truly limited only by our imaginations. This all being said, it is undeniable that games will play a massive role (if perhaps not the most massive role) in helping VR take off as a transformative new medium. Even Palmer Luckey himself has said that games are going to be what the industry is initially built on. It is clear that delivering incredible gaming experiences is a priority, and after going through the Crescent Bay demo it was clear that Oculus wanted to highlight one development platform for VR gaming, the Unreal Engine.",
        "Epic Games first showcased the Unreal Engine all the way back in 1998, and since then the platform has blossomed into one of the premier creation tools for first person gaming, which is why it is such a perfect marriage for VR. Epic Games has also been known to push the envelope before with new gaming platforms, like it did with Infinity Blade on mobile, a game which redefined mobile gaming and proved console-quality graphics were possible on a smartphone. With Infinity Blade now on it’s third iteration, and VR on the ever-closing horizon, Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) and Epic Games are getting serious about VR.",
        "Unreal Engine 4 has been on the VR train for about two years now, it seems like yesterday at this point but it was all the way back in 2013 when we first saw Jimmy Fallon trying out the Epic Citadel demo in January which was running on UE3. Unreal followed this up with its Elemental VR demo at E3 in June which showed off the power of UE4 in VR for the first time, picking up a bunch of awards along the way.  Since then a lot has happened with the development of games on the platform, including Oculus embracing the engine as their preferred one for internal development. While no official announcement has been made to this necessarily from the Oculus brass, actions speak louder than words. At both CES and Oculus Connect, UE4 was used to run most, if not all of the demos, including even adding a UE4 splash screen in between certain demos. Most notably, the showcase, final demo shown at both events was “Showdown” (or as Epic calls it, “Car Flip”) which may be the most polished looking demo out there right now, providing gamers and enthusiasts a glimpse of what AAA titles might look like on the Rift.",
        "Speaking of potential AAA titles, a number of other “mainstream” VR experiences are using the platform now. Eve: Valkyrie, which recently made the switch from Unity to UE4, is one of those titles. Lead game developer Chris Smith told Polygon, “it’s just a great engine that renders a great game. It allows me to express what I need to express on a tool I’m familiar with.” Smith continued further, likening moving the game from Unity to UE4 to “turning it into a real boy.” Another major upcoming VR game, Adr1ft, also made the switch from Unity to UE4. It’s clear that as we move towards true consumer VR UE4 is going help lead the way, and that is a good thing.",
        "UE4 has long been one of the, if not the best, platforms for developing first person perspective experiences so it really makes sense that as we are transporting ourselves into the virtual world it is the platform a lot of developers are leaning on. Major studios like Kite & Lightning, Untold Games, and White Lotus Interactive are all on board with the engine and creating VR experiences. Oculus is already showcasing them as the platform for their pre-CV1 prototype, the Crescent Bay. So what are some of the things that make UE4 so great for developers? First of all, UE4 looks great right out of the box its beautiful and easy to use and makes some pretty impressive looking games. Second, it is open source software, which is huge during such a nascent time in the VR industry where things seemingly change every week. Speaking of that, it comes with Oculus support directly out of the box, without the use of any plugins. For the programming portion, there is some great visual programming the platform offers with the blueprint system. All this with a cheap monthly subscription of only $19, and you have a great platform for developers to start building incredibly detailed VR experiences.",
        "2015 is going to be a great year for VR, and I fully expect we will see quite a lot of the spinning UE4 logo in our HMDs over the course of it."

        "Oovoo, one of the leading social media companies in the world, is getting into the VR space, according to JP Nauseef the company's managing director. In an exclusive interview with Upload, Nauseef and CMO Chris Wire revealed the company has plans to integrate its platform with Oculus VR.",
        "“The universe of possibilities is virtually endless,” said Nauseef, “we are picking the applications very carefully but integration with Oculus is one of those.” When pressed for further details Nauseef remained coy, “we want to save some surprises for later.” However, he promised that further announcements in the next two quarters and hinted at the mobile world conference and Barcelona being the place where the platform will be revealed. “This is the year, it's going to be exciting.”",
        "This is all obviously extremely exciting for VR as it has the potential to be a revolutionary social platform. With 120 million registered users Oovoo is one of Skype's top competitors and is one of the top social media apps in the world. The potential of this marriage is obvious as it would expose the massive, established user base to virtual reality.",
        "This news all comes at the same time as Oovoo announced its intelligent video platform powered by  FaceShift technology. At the booth the company was demoing this new tech in an impressive way, stay tuned for that video later."

        "The International CES is now officially underway, so of course I woke up early and made a bee-line for the Oculus booth, which is thoroughly impressive in and of itself. A two story well appointed behemoth, it's clear that Oculus is a centerpiece at this year's CES. But enough about the booth, lets get right to the thing we have all been so excited to see, the new Crescent Bay.",
        "This was my first time getting the chance to try on the new prototype, which many are speculating is the last version before CV1, so I was obviously super pumped to try it on and I will tell you right now, I hadn't even prepared myself for the level of epicness that I witnessed within the demo. It was seriously that good, and if there are any skeptics still out there, be ready to have your skepticism completely washed away.",
        "I walked into the soundproofed booth and the first thing I noticed was the lack of any chairs in the room, right away they wanted to make sure this was a standing experience. My demo leader asked me a couple of questions and took my glasses then prepared to hand me the most life changing piece of hardware I have ever had the pleasure of trying. After a brief adjustment or two the first demo fired up but not before I was told five words that would utterly transform the VR experience for me, “go ahead and walk around.”",
        "The first demo placed me in a futuristic looking boiler room, as I walked around I found quickly that the padded walls provided more than just excellent sound proofing. The positional tracking on the Crescent Bay is massively improved over the DK2 and it really showed during this demo, true to what I was told, I was able to maneuver rather freely within the environment. How's the display, you ask? Un-be-fucking-leavable. Seriously, this thing was so crisp and clear that in the 10-15 minutes (it was so immersive I completely lost track of time) of demos I tried it provoked more audible “Holy shit's!” than the South Park episode with the shit counter. Seriously, I think the demoer was enjoying watching me as much as I was enjoying demoing, but I digress.",
        "The Crescent Bay has completely solved the screen door effect that plagued the DK1 and to a lesser degree the DK2. The display was also far more crisp than the DK2, I have found that with my eyesight sometimes in the DK2 objects would occasionally appear fairly blurry, this was definitely not the case with the Crescent Bay. None of the demoes that I tried really had any text in them, so I can't comment yet on the readability of it, however there was one of the demoes that had some sheet music on a stand that I walked over and leaned in on and it looked crystal clear up close, although before I approached it, it did appear slightly pixelated, but I think that may have been a rendering glitch.",
        "Each of the 18 demos that I was ran through showed off a different aspect of the technology and how it could be applied across multiple genres and mediums. While there was no 360-degree video demo per se, there was a hilarious demo with two robot arms that got into a fight with magic wands, it was very reminiscent of the original Pixar lamp short. The demo really showed off the narrative power of videos in VR as the fight commenced and the robots shifted to either side of the peripheral vision firing colorful, Harry Potter-esque bolts of magic at each other. As I shifted directions to track the bolts I found myself physically reacting and dodging them as they came towards my face, it was one of the first times I have had a truly subconscious physical reaction to VR and was definitely one of my first moments of true presence. There was a similar effect achieved for me during the bullet time demo, Showdown – which was shown at Connect last year – as the 3D was so great that I really felt like I was moving in slow motion through a firefight with a giant robot, I took the opportunity to practice my Matrix moves as I dipped and dodged to avoid the bullets and shrapnel.",
        "Speaking of the 3D, I am not sure what it was, perhaps just optimization of the experiences, but it felt massively improved over the DK2. This was especially true during the two demos that I tried that involved a T-Rex. The first was simply a highly detailed model that growled at you as you looked around it, but at that scale the sense of depth was truly impressive. The second placed me in a hallway, as I looked around I could sense something was about to happen and when it did… whoa nelly. A loud roar, heard incredibly clearly though the surprisingly impressive built in headphones, caused me to whip around to see a T-Rex bum rushing me, and as it got close and opened its mouth to take a bite, I felt myself putting my hands up, the only thing was missing was foul breath in my face but I can live without that.",
        "Another demo placed me in a familiar top of the being built skyscraper situation, but this one was far more clear than any other I have tried. One of the more hilarious highlights of this particular demo was a billboard featuring Palmer himself placed directly behind the player in the futuristic cityscape. My one gripe, and it's minor, is that I was a little disappointed I didn't go careening down to the concrete below when I stepped off the edge, although I did get a little bit of a weird feeling in the pit of my stomach as I peered down. Unlike the Sightline demo, this scene was at night, which really added to the beauty of the city scene, as the colors of the lights really popped.",
        "Speaking of colors perhaps the best demo for that was this one that was similar to the art style of Windracers. All it was was you sitting around a fire with a couple of cute forest animals, and it was extremely simple graphically but the colors all popped quite well. It did an excellent job of demonstrating how you don't need the most photorealistic graphics to create an immersive and enjoyable scene.",
        "By the end of the last demo, my cheeks hurt because I had been smiling so much in pure amazement and joy from the experience. It reminded me of the first time I tried VR, firing up a Titans of Space demo and sheading a tear out of pure amazement that this, something I had dreamed of my entire life, was actually going to be realized. Simply put, the Crescent Bay was like experiencing VR for the first time all over again.",
        "Make sure to stay tuned to Upload's coverage of CES, we will be bringing a 180-degree 3D camera out on the show floor, thanks to our friends over at Lucid Cam, so we should have some pretty great content to show all of you soon. Until then, stay Rifty."

        "When a sleeping giant snores, it can be heard across the planes. The same can be said for the ever-mysterious startup Magic Leap. Since being thrust into the public consciousness in October with a massive $542M funding round, Magic Leap has continued to operate largely in the shadows, yet clues to their plans continue to leak out across the internet; the latest of which seems to give a little more insight as to what we might expect from the device.",
        "A recently posted job description by Magic Leap on Gamasutra, says the company is “looking for the world’s best level designers” to join the team in collaboration with Weta Workshop to help design levels for a “truly next-generation Dr. Grordbort’s first person shooter.” According to the job description the game will be “a robot-disintegrating science fiction experience.” This game may well be one of, if not the, premiere launch titles for the new platform (or it may be another “red herring,” but more on that in a second).",
        "Weta Workshop, based in New Zealand, is the special effects house behind films like Avatar and all of the Lord of the Rings movies. They also produce a line of replica ray guns “made by” adventurer Dr. Grordbort which may give us a clue as to what this game’s look might be. It’s clear that the guys at Weta Workshop are impressed by the Magic Leap as a platform, Richard Taylor, Weta’s Co-Founder (who is also a member of the board of directors at Magic Leap) described the product as “a rocketship for the mind.”",
        "This is not the first time that Weta Workshop and Magic Leap have collaborated either, the two worked on a project together called “The Hour Blue” back in 2011. The project, however, like much of Magic Leap’s early marketing seems to be a bit of a psychedelic joke. In fact, in an interview with the South Florida Business Journal Magic Leap CEO, Rony Abovitz, called the app “a bit of a red herring.” In the same interview, Abovitz also described the reasons behind their relationship with Weta Workshop, saying that “not many people are as creatively open,” and “they are in New Zealand, they are… off the grid in a way – and we want that.”  Beyond secrecy, they are also one of the best special effects studios in the business, having taken home over 30 awards, including 5 Oscars.",
        "At the very least, we can take away from this that the device will, in fact, have both a consumer focus and will be involved in the gaming space right off the bat. The device itself, however, still remains shrouded in mystery. Most of the information available to us suggests that the device is essentially some form of perfected augmented reality that they are calling “Cinematic Reality™.” Abovitz offers some clarification (in his own enigmatic way) as to why they have chosen to go with a new term, rather than embracing the established ones:",
        "“Those are old terms – virtual reality, augmented reality. They have legacy behind them. They are associated with things that didn’t necessarily deliver on a promise or live up to expectations. We have the term cinematic reality because we are disassociated with those things. … When you see this, you will see that this is computing for the next 30 or 40 years. To go farther and deeper than we’re going, you would be changing what it means to be human.”",
        "I know I am not alone when I say that I’m ready for them to show the device already, a number of sources I have talked to in the company have expressed similar sentiments. But we have all waited this long, we can wait a little bit longer. Until now, our imaginations can continue to run wild about the device one investor called, “so badass you cannot believe it,” and I think thats exactly what Magic Leap is hoping we do."
